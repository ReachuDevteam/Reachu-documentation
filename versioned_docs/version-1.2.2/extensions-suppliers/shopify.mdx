The "Outshifter for Suppliers" application lets Suppliers connect and sync their
Shopify store with Outshifter.

## Introduction

Connect your store with Outshifter to easily synchronize inventory and product
information across multiple stores, platforms, and applications. Outshifter
automates the connection process and management, making it easier to work with
more partners, dropshippers and storefronts. While our technology ensures
product information and inventory is up to date and orders flow back to your
current store.

## Publishing

In order for a product to be available on the platform it first needs to be
published, to publish a product follow these steps:

      correct such as Sales Commissions before clicking **Publish**.
      Alternatively you can publish several products at once using bulk edits
      feature.

      a Channel or give access to one of your Connections.

## Orders

Once there's an order on one of your Channels or through one of your Connections
it will automatically appear in your Shopify.

You can, however, also find a complete overview of orders on the Outshifter
platform, by heading over to the **Orders** section in the main menu. There you
can find all the orders that have been made for the products you have published
on Outshifter.

status and collects the tracking number, which is communicated back to the
Channel, Connection and end customer.
