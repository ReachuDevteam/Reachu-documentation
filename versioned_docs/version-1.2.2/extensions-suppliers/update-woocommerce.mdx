# Update WooCommerce Plugin API Key

In our most recent update of the WooCommerce Plugin, we have gone away from
using the Outshifter username and password to connect to your WooCommerce.
Instead, we have implemented an API Key system. This will provide a more stable
and secure connection between the two systems. For our users it simply means
instead of using a username and password to establish the connection between
Outshifter and WooCommerce, there will be a unique ID associated with your
profile, The API Key. The reason for the update is to provide a more stable and
secure connection between the two systems.

We, therefore, ask all our users to update the Outshifter plugin and establish
the connection again using the API Key. It should not take more than a few
minutes. To get started please follow the ensuing steps:

- [ ] Log in to your WordPress/WooCommerce.

- [ ] Click on WooCommerce in your WordPress sidebar menu.

- [ ] Go to **Settings**. Within Settings, click on the tab called
      **Outshifter**.

- [ ] If you are logged click on Log Out.

- [ ] Click on **Plugins** in your WordPress sidebar menu.

- [ ] Find the **Outshifter export** plugin, and click on update now.

- [ ] Once the plugin is updated, you have to establish the connection between
      Outshifter and WooCommerce again using your **API Key**.

You will find the API Key in the settings section of your Outshifter profile.

- [ ] Go to https://app.outshifter.com/login and log in using your Outshifter
      username and Password.

- [ ] Head over to the **Settings** section by pressing the icon in the top
      right corner.

- [ ] Select **Sales Channels**.

- [ ] Then **copy the API Key** (in the event that there is no API Key
      generated, press the create button, then copy the Key.
