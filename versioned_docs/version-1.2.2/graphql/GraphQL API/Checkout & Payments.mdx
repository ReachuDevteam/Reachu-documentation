# Checkout & Payments

<font color="grey" size="5">

Flow from adding an item to the cart to completing the order.

</font>

The below process describes the key milestones in the checkout process flow in
Outshifter. There are also additional steps that may occur along the way;
however, the purpose of this instruction is to deliver a base reference for the
user to work with. We assume that at this stage, you have already completed the
steps included in the section of this chapter and that you are familiar with the
basic setup of the Outshifter GraphQL API.

Our order creation flow is as follows:

- **Cart**: an object will all the items added to the cart by a potential buyer.
  This has to be handled on the frontend. Alternatively
- **Checkout Initiation**: an object which groups all the data needed for the
  checkout process. You can still update at this time so it can be used as an
  alternative cart if wanted to.
- **Shipping Methods**: the way orders will be sent. E.g. postal service, click
  & collect.
- **Payment Method**: a payment provider. E.g., Stripe, Klarna.
- **Payments**: this object contains status and additional data about payment.
  Payments are processed and stocks reserved.
- **Checkout Completion**: once the payment succeeds, the checkout is finished.
- **Order Creation**: When all the above is completed, the order will be created
  internally in Outshifter.

## Cart

If you are not using Outshifter's storefront SDK, the shopping cart has to be
handled by the partner's built frontend.

You may also use the checkout as a cart. If you check the "Updating the checkout
items" section below, you can see how to manage the items in the checkout once
initiated.

## Checkout initiation

### Checkout permissions

A Checkout initiation object can only be created for logged in partner users,
who can then query the created checkout data.

### Checkout creation

To create a `Checkout` object, use the `checkoutCreate` mutation.

This mutation takes the following input:

- `channel`: Slug of a channel in which to create checkout.
- `email`: the final customer's email address.
- `shippingAddress`: the shipping address (if needed).
- `billingAddress`: the billing address.
- `items`: a list of checkout items (products), each item contains the product
  ID, a product variant ID and its quantity.

The resulting `Checkout` object contains the following fields:

- `id`: a unique checkout ID.
- `totalPrice`: the total price of the checkout items and shipping costs.
- `availableShippingMethods`: a list of available shipping methods for this
  checkout. If the items in the cart require shipment.
- `availablePaymentGateways`: a list of payment gateways that are currently
  configured on your partner Outshifter account and can be used to pay for the
  checkout. Only gateways which support the checkout currency are returned. For
  each gateway, API returns an ID, a name, and a config object, which for some
  gateways may return additional information required to process the payment in
  the frontend.

:::info In case there was an error after the mutation was sent, you will receive
an error object in the result. :::

**Example**

The mutation creates the checkout object and returns the checkout information.

Mutation -> `CheckoutCreateMutation`

Mutation input -> `CheckoutCreateInput`

Mutation response -> `CheckoutCreate`

```json
mutation {
  checkoutCreate(
    input: {
      channel: "partner-name",
      email: "customer@example.com"
      items: [{
        productId: 244,
        variantName: "Small-Black"
        quantity: 1,
      }],
      shippingAddress: {
        firstName: "John"
        lastName: "Doe"
        address: "Nydalsveien 14"
        city: "Oslo"
        postalCode: "1484"
        country: "Norway"
        countryCode: "NO"
      }
      billingAddress: {
        firstName: "John"
        lastName: "Doe"
        address: "Nydalsveien 14"
        city: "Oslo"
        postalCode: "1484"
        country: US
        countryArea: "MI"
      }
    }
  ) {
  checkout {
    id
    totalPrice {
      amount
      currency
    }
    availableShippingMethods {
      id
      name
    }
    availablePaymentGateways {
      id
      name
    }
  }
  errors {
    field
    code
  }
}
```

And in the response you get the requested information for the checkout:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "checkoutCreate": {
      "checkout": {
        "id": "Q2hlY2tvdXQ6ZmE5ZjBkMjYtMWM3NC00MDgyLTk3MzktYTIxOGE2NzVjMDZk",
        "totalPrice": {
          "amount": 1000,
          "currency": "USD"
        },
        "availableShippingMethods": [
          {
            "id": "2",
            "name": "UPS"
          },
          {
            "id": "4",
            "name": "DHL"
          }
        ],
        "availablePaymentGateways": [
          {
            "id": "1",
            "name": "Klarna"
          },
          {
            "id": "2",
            "name": "Stripe"
          }
        ]
      },
      "errors": []
    }
  }
}
```

## Updating items

You may add, update or remove a product from the checkout. This allows you to
treat the checkout as a shopping cart if you want to.

### Adding a product

Mutation -> `checkoutItemsAdd`

Use the add item's mutation and you will receive back the updated checkout.

```json
mutation {
  checkoutItemsAdd(
    id: "4b22fbc0-b095-4937-a08e-bd18d04c951a",
    items: [{
      quantity: 1,
      productId: 243,
      variantName: "Small-Red"
    }]
  ) {
    checkout {
      items {
        id
        variant {
          name
        }
        quantity
      }
      totalPrice {
        currency
        amount
      }
    }
  }
}
```

```json
{
  "data": {
    "checkoutItemsAdd": {
      "checkout": {
        "items": [
          {
            "productId": "321"
            "variant": {
              "name": "Small-Black"
            },
            "quantity": 1
          }
        ],
        "totalPrice": {
          "currency": "USD",
          "amount": 1000
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

      deliveryMethod {
          name
        }
      }
      totalPrice {
        amount
        currency

    }
    errors {
      field
      message

        "deliveryMethod": {
          "name": "Home delivery - Express"
        },
        "totalPrice": {
          "amount": "99.99",
          "currency": "USD"
        }
      },
      "errors": []
    }
  }
}
```

### Update shipping address

In case needed, shipping address can be updated using the
`checkoutShippingAddressUpdate` mutation.

```json
mutation {
  checkoutShippingAddressUpdate(
    checkoutId: "58f4ca17-9c6f-437b-8204-beb47bbee364"
    shippingAddress: {
      firstName: "John"
      lastName: "Doe"
      streetAddress1: "Nydalsveien 15"
      postalCode: "0484"
      city: "Oslo"
      country: "NO"
    }
  ) {
    checkout {
      shippingAddress {
        firstName
        lastName
        address
        city
        postalCode
      }
    }
    errors {
      field
      message
      code
    }
  }
}
```

Response:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "checkoutShippingAddressUpdate": {
      "checkout": {
        "shippingAddress": {
          "firstName": "John",
          "lastName": "Doe",
          "address1": "Nydalsveien 15",
          "city": "Oslo",
          "postalCode": "0184"
        }
      },
      "errors": []
    }
  }
}
```

## Payment

Depending on the selected payment gateway, you will need to use the JavaScript
form which will be then integrated to Outshifter.

- Partner requests for available payment methods.

- Outshifer sends available payment methods.

- After the payment is successful, the partner sends this information to confirm
  the order creation.

- Outshifter returns an object with the created order.

### Available payment gateways

Available payment gateways can be listed from the
Checkout.availablePaymentGateways field. Depending on the chosen gateway, you
may need additional configuration.

```json
query {
  checkout(checkoutId: "853ca234-b113-4021-8434-b37087d652a1"){
    availablePaymentGateways {
      id
      name
    }
  }
}
```

Outshifter works with the following payment methods. You as a partner will need
to implement them on the frontend. Follow instructions from their official
documentation:

- Klarna

<div class="homepage-section two-cols">
  <div class="section-content">
    <a class="homepage-card2">
      <div class="card-content">

      </div>
    </a>
  </div>
</div>

## Checkout completion

After the payment is successful, you will be able to trigger the internal order
creation.

Go to the next section to learn more about order creation:

<div class="homepage-section two-cols">
  <div class="section-content">
    <a class="homepage-card2">
      <div class="card-content">
        <div class="title">Orders</div>
      </div>
    </a>
  </div>
</div>

## Removing old checkouts

In order not to overflow the database, unfinished checkouts are deleted.
Anonymous and unfinished checkouts are deleted after a specified period of time
from the last modification:

- created checkouts with items, after 30 days
- checkouts without items, after 6 hours
