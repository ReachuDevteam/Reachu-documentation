Outshifter GraphQL API developer documentation for Channels

</font>

Welcome to the Outshifter GraphQL API developer documentation for Channels. Here
you'll find introductions to all features, as well as resources, guides, and
reference documentation for the APIs data structure.

GraphQL is a query language that allows clients to talk to an API server. Unlike
REST, it gives the client control over how much or how little data they want to
request about each object and allows relations within the object graph to be
easily traversed.

:::infoBETA disclaimer Please note that you are accessing the BETA versions of
Outshifter's APIs which are in the process of being tested before their official
release. This being so, Outshifter does not give any warranties, whether express
or implied, as to the suitability or usability of the APIs, its services, or any
of its content. The sole purpose of the BETA versions is to conduct testing and
obtain feedback. Should you encounter any bugs, glitches, lack of functionality,
