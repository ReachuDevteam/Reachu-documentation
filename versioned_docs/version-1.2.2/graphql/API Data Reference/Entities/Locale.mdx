Locales should be formatted as a language tag consisting of a two-letter
language code combined with a two-letter country code according to
[`RFC 5646`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IETF_language_tag). Examples are
_en-us_ for US English, _en-gb_ for British English and _nb-no_ for Norwegian.

Example:

```javascript
{
  "locale": "nb-no",
}
```
