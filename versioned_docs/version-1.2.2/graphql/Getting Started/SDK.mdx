How to get started with the SDK.

</font>

The SDK allows you to natively display product data from your Outshifter Catalog
on your Channel. Provide your users with a trouble-free checkout experience and
add payment services like Klarna or Stripe. Your users can pay and checkout
directly on your Channel and orders will be directly synchronized with the
Suppliers' eCommerce solution through the Outshifter API.

:::info The SDK is currently under development. Please fill out
[this form](https://outshifter.typeform.com/to/as0nILBN) to be notified once it
becomes available. :::
