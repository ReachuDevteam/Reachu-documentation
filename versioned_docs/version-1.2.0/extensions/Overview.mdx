Outshifter provides a range of plug-and-play applications and integrations to
third-party services to help you quickly get started.

This documentation explains how to install and use our applications and
integrations. All our extensions are plug-and-play, which means that they are
fully developed and supported by Outshifter. They require none or very little
coding to be implemented.

#### User types

Outshifter is the API for product data access. You can use Outshifter to give or
get access to product data, and manage it all in one universal format.

We distinguish between two key user types, determined by how Outshifter is
utilized:

- Supplier - Managing and sharing access to my product data with multiple
  Channels.
- Channel - Getting access to work with product data from multiple Suppliers.
