The GraphQL Playground is an external interactive editor for your GraphQL
queries based on GraphQL and accessible through the web browser.

Outshifter exposes an interactive GraphQL editor under /graphql/, allowing you
to access the API from your browser.

Using Playground is easy and intuitive with its sidebar navigation containing
two main usable tabs (Schema and Explorer), listing all operations available in
the API. The Playground allows you to quickly familiarize yourself with the API,
perform example operations, and send your first queries.

To view and try out the Playground instance of the Outshifter's GraphQL API,
visit our Apollo Studio explorer:
