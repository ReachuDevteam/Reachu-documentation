# Magento Extension

## The Magento extension lets Suppliers connect and sync their Magento (Adobe Commerce) store

## with Outshifter.

## Introduction

```
Outshifter is the API for product data access. Suppliers can use Outshifter to manage and share access to their product
data with multiple Channels.
The Magento extension lets Suppliers connect and sync their Magento (Adobe Commerce) store with Outshifter. It allows
Suppliers to select and automatically export products to Outshifter. Outshifter then converts the product data into a
universal format that can be distributed, synchronized and updated across Channels. Suppliers can then use the
Outshifter platform to manage and give selected Channels access to their product data.
