## Introduction

**Outshifter is the API for product data access**. Suppliers can use Outshifter
to manage and share access to their product data with multiple Channels.

The Outshifter App for Squarespace lets Suppliers connect and sync their
Squarespace store with Outshifter. It allows Suppliers to select and
automatically export products to Outshifter. Outshifter then converts the
product data into a universal format that can be distributed, synchronized and
updated across Channels. Suppliers can then use the Outshifter platform to
manage and give selected Channels access to their product data.

## Features

## Installation

Please follow these steps to get started:

Obtain a Squarespace **Developer Key** that will later be used on the Outshifter
platform to connect your Squarespace store with your Outshifter account.

To do this:

- [ ] Go to the main page of your Squarespace store.

- [ ] Open the **Settings** section found in the sidebar on the left-hand side
      of your screen.

- [ ] Within settings go to the section called **Advanced**.

- [ ] Open it and select the option called **Developer API Key**.

- [ ] A modal will open asking you to set a name to identify your key, and a
      series of permissions that you must grant in order for the export of
      products to be successful.
