How to get the user token needed for authentication.

</font>

The Outshifter API Key is used as authentication for all your Outshifter API
requests. You need access to your Outshifter Account in order to generate the
API Key.

:::info If you haven't already set up an Outshifter Channel account you need to
request access to register by filling out
[this form](https://outshifter.typeform.com/to/as0nILBN) :::

## Generate the Outshifter API Key

- [ ] Log in to your Outshifter Account, go to **Settings** (available in the
      top right hand corner) and select Sales Channels in the menu.

- [ ] Click the **Create** button. This will automatically generate the API Key
      for your user.

- [ ] Copy the API Key.

The Key can be used as an authentication method for all your Outshifter API
requests.

## Authentification

In order to send requests to the Outshifter API, you need to be authenticated
and supply a token for all requests. Every Outshifter user has a unique
authorization token or API Key.

:::info Your API requests will not work unless you include the API token. Make
sure you add the API token to the request in the headers as an authorization
key. See the example below. :::

### Example:

Example Outshifter API Key: RPMEQ4W-BXA44VW-Q6TVA8X-K12RVGJ

Authorization: RPMEQ4W-BXA44VW-Q6TVA8X-K12RVGJ

```json
headers: {
    authorization: RPMEQ4W-BXA44VW-Q6TVA8X-K12RVGJ
}
```
