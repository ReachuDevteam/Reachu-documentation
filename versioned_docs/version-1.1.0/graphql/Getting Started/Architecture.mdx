Outshifter consists of three distinct components that communicate using GraphQL
over HTTPS:

1. The **Outshifter Core**, which is the backend server that exposes the GraphQL
   API.

2. The **Outshifter Dashboard** implements the user interface that
   administration members use to manage a Channel. The dashboard is a React
   application that runs in the browser and talks to the core server. It's a
   static website so it does not have any backend code of its own.

3. The **kick-start storefront template** which is an example storefront
   implemented in React. You can customize its code to suit your needs or you
   can build a custom storefront using the underlying **Outshifter SDK**.
