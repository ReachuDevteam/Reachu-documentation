Create, update and get an order in the Outshifter Platform.

</font>

## Create new order

Once the payment was successful, this means that the checkout is finished and
the order can be created.

An order mutation will transform the checkout data into an order. It should
include:

- channel
- final customer
- purchased products
- shipping costs
- payment processor

Example of required fields in a checkout object before the checkoutComplete
mutation activates the order creation:

```json
{
    channel: {
        id: 1,
        name: 'Partner'
    }
    channelCreatedDate: '1994-11-05T13:15:30Z',
    channelOrderName: '#1001',
    paymentProcessor: 'Klarna',
    currency: "NOK",
    customer: {
        fullName: 'Jane Doe',
        email: 'jane@doe.com',
        phone: '+4563727263',
        shippingContactName: 'Jane Doe',
        shippingAddress: 'my strret',
        shippingCity: 'my city',
        shippingState: 'my state',
        shippingZip: 'my city',
        shippingCountry: 'NO',
        billingName: 'Jane Doe',
        billingAddress: 'my strret billing',
        billingZip: 'my zip billing',
        billingCity: 'my city billing',
        billingState: 'Oslo',
        billingCountry: 'NO',
    },
    items: [
        {
            productId: 25,
            quantity: 1,
            priceChannel: 100
            variantTitle: "M-White"
        }
    ]
    shippingItems: [
        {
            code: "1214089-FRP",
            title: "Flat rate price to NO",
            price: 25
        }
    ]
}
```

**Checkout Mutation**

The checkoutComplete mutation just needs as an input:

- `checkoutId`: the unique id of the previously created checkout

This action will create the order and it will take data from the checkout
object.

```json
mutation {
  checkoutComplete(
    checkoutId: "fd18c322-f816-406b-a71f-d9ce6a39c768"
  ) {
    order {
      id
      status
    }
    errors {
      field
      message
    }
  }
}
```

## Get orders

You can retrieve all orders from a seller that have been processed throughout
the partners specific storefront. You will not receive all seller orders but
just the ones of that channel.

You can query the orders and select the fields you are interested in receiving.

```json
query {
  orders {
    id
    channel
    channelOrderName
    channelCreatedDate
    currency
    paymentProcessor
    shippingPrice
    shippingTitle
    shippingCode
    reseller {
      id
      username
    }
    status
    items {
      id
      quantity
      status
      product {
        id
        title
      }
      supplier {
        id
        username
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Response:

```json

  "data": {
    "orders": [
      {
        "id": 1082,
        "channel": {
          "id": "pi_3Jp7n6CClYvoTSYs0TUE6Fyd",

      },
      ...
    ]
  }
}
```

## Cancel an order item

This endpoint allows a customer to update the order item status to “CANCELED”.

Take into account, that the cancellation is item based, and not order based. So
if the order has only one product, the whole order will be cancelled, but if it
has several products, you will need to cancel each one individually if it
corresponds.

:::info Order cancellation is available only before shipping. If the customer
has already received the items or they have already been shipped, then a return
form must be completed in the Outshifter's return solution. :::

:::info Item cancellation will also trigger an intern email to the supplier, the
seller and the customer. :::

Use the ordeItemCancel mutation to update the status of the item to cancelled.

As arguments, you will need to provide:

- `orderId`: unique identifier of the order.
- `itemId`: each item has a unique id.

```javascript
mutation {
  orderItemCancel(
    orderId: "4b22fbc0-b095-4937-a08e-bd18d04c951a",
    itemId: "1470"
  ) {
    order {
      items {
        id
        status
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Response:

```javascript
{
  "data": {
    "order": {
      "items": [
        {
          "id": 1470,
          "status": "CANCELLED",
        },
        ...
      ]
    }
  }
}
```
