## Publishing

In order for a product to be available on the platform it first needs to be

- [ ] When your products have been synced, log in to your Outshifter account at
      outshifter.com

- [ ] Go to **Products** in the menu.

- [ ] All synced products will be labeled **Drafts**.

- [ ] Click on a product and the listing will open. Make sure all information is
      correct such as Sales Commissions before clicking **Publish**.
      Alternatively you can publish several products at once using bulk edits
      feature.

- [ ] Once the product is published you can add it to a **Collection**, export
      it to a Channel or give access to one of your Connections.

## Orders

Once there's an order on one of your Channels or through one of your Connections
it will automatically appear in your WooCommerce.

You can, however, also find a complete overview of orders on the Outshifter
platform, by heading over to the **Orders** section in the main menu. There you
can find all the orders that have been made for the products you have published
on Outshifter.

Order information on the Outshifter platform includes:

- Order number

- The date the order was placed

- Product information

- Customer information

- Total price

- Order status

- Shipping

- Channel

- Sales Commission

You can use the search bar and filters to find specific orders.

## Fulfillment

**Auto-fulfillment**

Once you have fulfilled an order, Outshifter automatically updates the order
status and collects the tracking number, which is communicated back to the
Channel, Connection and end customer.

**Manual fulfillment**

In case you need to provide the fulfillment information in Outshifter manually:

- [ ] [Log in](https://app.outshifter.com/login) to your Outshifter account.
