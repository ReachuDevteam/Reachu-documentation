# Product

In order to get product information you need to interact with the channel
endpoint. You can choose to get:

- all products from all your channels
- all products from a specific channel
- individual product information by using the product id

## Get all products

Retrieve an array of all the products to added to your channels.

```js
async function fetchAllProducts() => {
  const sdk = getSDK();
  const products = await sdk.channel.item.getAll();
  return products;
});
```

Response:

```json
[
  {
    "id": 8,
    "channel": "Vev",
    "list_products": [
      {
        "createdAt": "2023-03-02T09:27:03.383Z",
        "id": 5797,
        "title": "T-shirt",
        "status": 1,
        "description": "<p>T-shirt description</p>"
      }
    ],
    "totalProducts": 2,
    "collections": [],
    "variants": [],
    "products": [
      {
        "createdAt": "2023-03-02T09:27:03.383Z",

:::info

This feature is designed to display a list of products on the frontend of your
solution. It provides you with general product information. If you want
additional more detailed data, see the below in the “Get detailed product
information by id” section below.

:::

The getAll() also accepts as an optional parameter the id of your channel. You
will get an array of just the products of that channel:

```js
async function fetchAllProductsByChannel() => {
  const sdk = getSDK();
  const products = await sdk.channel.item.getAll(CHANNEL_ID); // CHANNEL_ID: number
  return products;
});
```

Response:

```json
[
  {
    "createdAt": "2023-03-02T09:27:03.383Z",
    "id": 5797,
    "title": "T-shirt",
    "description": "<p>T-shirt description</p>"
  },
  {
    "createdAt": "2023-03-02T09:27:03.383Z",
    "id": 5798,
    "title": "Pants",
    "description": "<p>Pants description</p>"
  }
]
```

:::info

If you need information about which is your channel id, use this sdk operation.
You will get all active channels with their respective ids.

```js
async function getActiveChannels() => {
  const sdk = getSDK();
  const channels = await sdk.channel.base.getAllActive();
  return channels;
});
```

```json
[
  {
    "createdAt": "2022-10-14T14:24:24.044Z",
    "updatedAt": "2022-10-14T14:24:24.322Z",
    "deletedAt": null,
    "id": 2,
    "name": "Shopify",
    "enabled": true
  },
  {
    "createdAt": "2022-10-14T14:24:24.044Z",
    "updatedAt": "2022-10-14T14:24:24.322Z",
    "deletedAt": null,
