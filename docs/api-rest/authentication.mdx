## Authentication

To ensure secure communication with Reachu's API, authentication via API Key is
required. This section provides detailed instructions on how to use your API Key
to authenticate your requests, granting you access to the powerful features of
Reachu's platform.

### Overview

The API Key is a unique identifier used to authenticate requests to Reachu's
API. It verifies the identity of the requester and ensures that only authorized
users and applications can access the API. You must include your API Key in the
header of each request you make to the API.

### Obtaining Your API Key

   settings. If you do not have an API Key or cannot locate it, please contact
