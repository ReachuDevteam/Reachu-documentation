# Quick settup

You can easily integrate Rsseach to your project with our GraphQL API!

It's fast, flexible, and reliable â€” with zero-runtime.

## Get you Api Key

To interact with the Reachu GraphQL API, you need to create a channel on the
Reachu platform.

#### 1. Create a Reachu account here:

https://test.reachu.io/

#### 2. Create a GraphQL Channel:

#### 3. Get you Api key for development:

## Initialization of you GraphQL Client

The SdkClient is the root class of the SDK. It is the main entry point of the
SDK. It is the only class that you need to instantiate in order to use the SDK.
To instantiate SdkClient, you can run the following command:

```GraphQL
const sdk = new SdkClient('YOUR_API_KEY', 'https://api.reachu.io');
```

It is recommended that the new SdkClient method is called prior to any other SDK
operations. You can then call the getSDK function every time you need to use an
SDK operation.

```js
import { SdkClient } from '@reachu/sdk';

let sdk: SdkClient;

export function getSDK(): SdkClient {
  if (!sdk) sdk = new SdkClient('YOUR_API_KEY', 'https://api.reachu.io');
  return sdk;
}
```
