# Quick settup

You can easily integrate Rsseach to your project with our GraphQL API!

It's fast, flexible, and reliable â€” with zero-runtime.

## Introductions

To interact with the Reachu GraphQL API, you need to create a channel on the
Reachu platform.

#### 1. Create a Reachu account here:

```GraphQL
https://test.reachu.io/
```

import DocusaurusImageUrl from '@site/static/img/signup.png';

<img src={signUpImg} width={500} />

#### 2. Create a GraphQL Channel:

<img src={createChannelImg} width={500} />

#### 3. Get you Api key for development:

<img src={getApikeyImg} width={500} />

## Initialization of you GraphQL Client

The SdkClient is the root class of the SDK. It is the main entry point of the
SDK. It is the only class that you need to instantiate in order to use the SDK.
To instantiate SdkClient, you can run the following command:

```javascript
import { GraphQLClient, gql } from 'graphql-request';

const endpoint = 'https://graph-ql-dev.reachu.io/';
const client = new GraphQLClient(endpoint);
const headers = {
  Authorization: '<API Key Here>',
};
```
