Dyte can livestream any service that can accept an RTMP input (Zoom, YouTube
etc.) in few simple steps.

1. Create a live stream using the API call
2. Add the RTMP input received from the response into your service.

## Create a live stream

Request:

```shell
curl --location --request POST 'https://api.dyte.in/v2/livestreams' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--header 'Authorization: Basic ORGID:APIKEY' \
--data-raw '{
    "name": "some name"
}'
```

Response:

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "id": "STREAMID",
    "title": "STREAMNAME",
    "input_rtmp_url": "rtmp://URL/LiveApp/STREAMID?token=TOKENID",
    "token_id": "TOKENID",
    "stream_key": "STREAMID?token=TOKENID",
    "player_url": "https://URL/LiveApp/play.html?name=STREAMID",
    "status": "OFFLINE",
    "hls_play_url": "https://URL/LiveApp/streams/STREAMID.m3u8"
  }
}
```

From the response

1. `data.input_rtmp_url` can be used as an input to any other RTMP compatible
   app or API (such as OBS, Twitch, YouTube, etc)

For example, for adding it to OBS:

![obs-example](/static/guides/obs-example.png) _User is adding the input stream
to OBS_

## Get a livestream instance information

Request:

```shell
curl --location --request GET 'https://api.cluster.dyte.in/v2/livestreams/STREAMID' \
--header 'Authorization: Basic your-api-key'
```

Respone:

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "id": "STREAMID",
    "title": "STREAMNAME",
    "input_rtmp_url": "rtmp://URL/LiveApp/STREAMID?token=TOKENID",
    "token_id": "TOKENID",
    "stream_key": "STREAMID?token=TOKENID",
    "player_url": "https://URL/LiveApp/play.html?name=STREAMID",
    "status": "OFFLINE",

  }
}
```

# Livestreaming API Integration Guide

#

Dyte Livestreaming adds live video and voice interactive streaming to any online
experience. It provides complete control over the streaming experience, from a
simple one-to-many stream to a highly interactive live event.

Dyte allows livestreaming, via RTMP as well as HLS, for all Dyte meetings. If
you want us to manage the output to RTMP instead, check
[this doc instead](./livestreaming-other-platforms).

Dyte Livestreaming provides two modes of operations:

1. Livestreaming Independently
2. Livestreaming a Meeting

These modes help you manage various livestream usecases. Letâ€™s understand what
both of these mean:

- **Livestreaming Independently**: If you want to control what you stream and
  how it is distributed, this is the way to go. Individual ingest URLs can be
  created for ingesting a livestream from apps like OBS, ffmpeg, and others, as
  well as playback URLs to play it in your preferred player.

- **Livestreaming a Meeting**: If you want to stream a meeting to a large number
  of people, this is an excellent option. Dyte provides APIs to automatically
  start livestreaming a meeting, as well as an SDK player that allows users to
  watch the livestream in high quality. For example, livestream a meeting for an
  events platform, a virtual workspace to host large events such as hackathons,
  conferences, or even your own metaverse party.

## Livestreaming independently

Run the following command to generate credentials for a new independent
livestream.

- Request

```bash
curl --request POST \
  --url https://api.cluster.dyte.in/v2/livestreams \

```

- Response

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "message": "livestream stopped"
  }
}
```

To learn more about the Dyte livestreaming APIs, see
[Livestreaming APIs](https://docs.dyte.io/api#/).

## Getting Authentication Token

The **Add Participant** API call returns your authentication token. See
[Add a participant](https://docs.dyte.io/api#/operations/addParticipant). Room
name is generated when you create a meeting. You can get the room name from the
developer portal or using REST APIs. For more information, see
[Create a meeting](https://docs.dyte.io/api#/operations/createMeeting).

# Livestreaming Dyte Meetings to other platforms

Dyte can livestream your meeting to any platform which supports an RTMP endpoint
like YouTube, Twitch etc. All you need to do is pass that RTMP endpoint while
you [start the recording](/api/#/operations/start_recording).

For example, if you want to stream it to [restream.io](https://restream.io), you
can do:

```shell
curl --request POST \
  --url https://api.dyte.in/v1/organizations/orgid/meetings/meetingid/recording \
  --header 'Authorization: APIKEY yourapi-key' \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data '{
	"liveStreamingConfig": {
  		"rtmpUrl": "rtmp://live.restream.io/live/your-stream-key"
  	}
}'
```

And it just works ðŸ™Œ

### Considerations

1. Currently, you need to [start a recording](/api/#/operations/start_recording)
   to live stream your content.
2. There is few seconds of lag between the meeting and the stream.

# Recording your meetings via Dyte

We allows recordings for all Dyte meetings. This feature records the grid part
of the meeting. The result of the recording is an mp4 file, encoded using
`H.264` codec (this can be changed).

Usually to record a meeting, the flow of APIs is like below:

1. Start a recording by using the
   [`POST` endpoint](/api/#/operations/start_recording).
2. Poll the [`GET` endpoint](/api/#/operations/get_recording) to check the
   status of recording.
3. Stop the recording by using the
   [`PUT` endpoint](/api/#/operations/stop_recording).
4. Use the [`GET` endpoint](/api/#/operations/get_recording) again to get a
   pre-signed URL for downloading the recording.

You can also use
[webhooks as described here](./integrating-with-webhooks#recordingstatusupdate)
to subscribe to meeting status update events instead of polling.

## Recording states

Recording can have one of these states, which are also notified through
[webhooks](./integrating-with-webhooks#recordingstatusupdate):

| Name      | Description                                                                                                                                                                |
| --------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| INVOKED   | The recording function has been invoked and will start recording the meeting very shortly.                                                                                 |
| RECORDING | The meeting is currently being recorded.                                                                                                                                   |
| UPLOADING | The recording has been stopped and the file is being uploaded to cloud storage. The storage would be Dyte's if no storage parameters are passed in the recording API call. |
| UPLOADED  | The recording file upload is complete.                                                                                                                                     |
| ERRORED   | There was an error while recording the meeting and the file wouldn't be available.                                                                                         |

## Considerations for a recording

1. Recording will stop if there is no participant in the meeting for 60 seconds
   (1 minute).
2. There can only be one active recording of a meeting.
3. Average size for one hour of recording is approximately `300MB`.
4. Maximum recording time is 24 hours. Recording will automatically stop after
   the expiry of that period from the time of recording start. This option can
   be configured by passing the `maxSeconds` parameter in the start recording
   API.

## Recording settings

You can modify the codec which is used for recording the videos. We currently
support three codecs

1. H264 (default):
   [sample recording](https://dyte-uploads.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/test/h264_sample.webm)
2. VP8:
   [sample recording](https://dyte-uploads.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/test/vp8_sample.webm)
3. VP9:
   [sample recording](https://dyte-uploads.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/test/vp9_sample.webm)

:::caution Resolution

By default, Dyte uses a resolution of 720p for all recordings. If there is a
requirement for a higher resolution, please contact us directly to configure the
same for your organization.

:::

You can change the codec by specifying the codec in `videoConfig` when you are
creating a recording.

```shell
curl --request POST \
  --url https://api.dyte.in/v1/organizations/orgid/meetings/meetingid/recording \
  --header 'Authorization: APIKEY yourapi-key' \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data '{
	"videoConfig": {
		"codec": "VP8"
	}
}'
```

## Publishing a recording to your cloud provider

You can pass an optional object `storageConfig` in the start recording request
and we will publish the recording directly to your cloud provider once it stops.
If a `path` is specified, the recorded video will be stored there, otherwise the
default is the root of the directory. The filename for recording will be the
same as given in `outputFileName` in the [start recording](ref:startrecording)
response.

:::caution Limited access keys

Please make sure that the cloud keys you provide to Dyte APIs have only limited
access.

:::

```shell
curl --request POST \
  --url https://api.dyte.in/v1/organizations/orgid/meetings/meetingid/recording \
  --header 'Authorization: APIKEY your-api-key' \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data '{
	    "storageConfig": {
                "type": "aws",
                "accessKey": "aws_access_key",
                "secret": "aws_secret",
