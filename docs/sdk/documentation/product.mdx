# Product

In order to get product information you need to interact with the channel
endpoint. You can choose to get all products at once or individual product
information by using the product id.

## Get all products

Retrieve an array of all the products to added to your channels.

```js
async function fetchAllProducts() => {
  const sdk = getSDK();
  const products = await sdk.channel.item.getAll();
  return products;
});
```

Response:

```json
[
  {
    "id": 8,
    "channel": "Vev",
    "list_products": [
      {
        "createdAt": "2023-03-02T09:27:03.383Z",
        "id": 5797,
        "title": "T-shirt",
        "status": 1,
        "description": "<p>T-shirt description</p>"
      }
    ],
    "totalProducts": 2,
    "collections": [],
    "variants": [],
    "products": [
      {
        "createdAt": "2023-03-02T09:27:03.383Z",
        "id": 5797,
        "title": "T-shirt",
        "description": "<p>T-shirt description</p>"
      }
    ],
    "collectionsShared": []
  }
]
```

:::info

This feature is designed to display a list of products on the frontend of your
solution. It provides you with general product information. If you want
additional more detailed data, see the below in the “Get detailed product
information by id” section below.

:::

The getAll() also accepts as an optional parameter the id of your channel. You
will get an array of just the products of that channel:

```js
async function fetchAllProductsByChannel() => {
  const sdk = getSDK();
  const products = await sdk.channel.item.getAll(CHANNEL_ID);
  return products;
});
```

Response:

```json
[
  {
    "createdAt": "2023-03-02T09:27:03.383Z",
    "id": 5797,
    "title": "T-shirt",
    "description": "<p>T-shirt description</p>"
  },
  {
    "createdAt": "2023-03-02T09:27:03.383Z",
    "id": 5798,
    "title": "Pants",
    "description": "<p>Pants description</p>"
  }
]
```

## Get products by ids

Retrieve an array of the products added to your channel.

```js
const productIds = [ID1, ID2];

async function fetchProductsByIds(ids) {
  const sdk = getSDK();
  const products = await sdk.channel.item.getAllByProductList(
    CHANNEL_ID,
    ids: productIds
  );
  return products;
}
```

Response:

```json
[
  {
    "createdAt": "2023-03-02T09:27:03.383Z",
    "id": 5797,
    "title": "T-shirt",
    "description": "<p>T-shirt description</p>"
  },
  {
    "createdAt": "2023-03-02T09:27:03.383Z",
    "id": 5798,
    "title": "Pants",
    "description": "<p>Pants description</p>"
