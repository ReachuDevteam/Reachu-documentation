# Cart

An object with all the items added to the cart by a potential buyer. The
frontend can interact with our API to add, update or remove items.

:::info

The cart is intended to handle only product interacions (addition, removal or
update of quantity). Payment methods and shipping are handled on the
[checkout](/sdk/documentation/checkout).

:::

## Create cart

You can initiate the cart even before adding products to it, so you decide when
it's more convenient for you to do it. You need to provide us though with the
reference to the customer's session id that is created by you in the frontend.

Retrieve an array of the products added to your channel.

```js
  async function createCart() => {
    const sdk = getSDK();
    let newCart = await sdk.shopCart.cart.create({
      currency: string, // "EUR", "USD", "NOK", "DDK", "SEK", "CHF"
      customer_session_id: string, // We recommend an alphanumeric id
    });
  });
```

Response:

```json
{
  "cart_id": "dd961398-e3de-4204-9404-450b6170ddf3",
  "customer_session_id": "92sdj37257",
  "created_at": "2022-10-07T10:17:31.675Z",
  "updated_at": "2022-10-07T10:17:31.675Z",
  "line_items": [],
  "total_amount": 0,
  "currency": "EUR"
}
```

You may want to interact with a created cart in the following ways:

- add an additional item o multiple items to the cart object
- update the quantity of an added item
- remove an item or multiple items from the cart object

### Add an item

From the SDKs [product operations](/sdk/documentation/product), you get all
necessary information to complete the line_items object and add an item to the
cart.

:::info

It is possible to add more than one item on this endpoint, just add additional
objects to the line_items array.

:::

```js
async () => {
  const sdk = getSDK();

  await sdk.shopCart.cartItem.create({
    cartId: string,
    line_items: [
      {
        product_id: number,
        quantity: number,
        shipping_id: string,
        variant_id: string,
        price_data: {
          currency: string,
          tax: number,
          unit_price: number,
        },
      },
    ],
  });
};
```

```json
{
  "line_items": [
    {
