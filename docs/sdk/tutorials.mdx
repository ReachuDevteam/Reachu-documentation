# Tutorials

This short tutorial will explore how to integrate install and use Reachus SDKs
main operations, from fetching products to initiate a checkout. We will use
Reachus SDK to load our data using the Reachu API and enable the payment
solution.

## Requirements

To follow this tutorial, there are the following requirements:

- Basic understanding of React
- Node, yarn (or npm) installed
- An account on the [Reachu platform](https://www.reachu.io/)

## Setup the project

Let's start by creating a new
[React application](https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html).

```shell
npx create-react-app my-app
cd my-app
```

Next, we need to install the Reachu SDK

```shell
npm i @reachu/sdk
```

Then, let's start the development server

```shell
npm start
```

## Connecting to Reachu

Now that we kickstarted our project, we need to create a connection to Reachu
and enable the store solution.

To initialize the connection, go to src/, create a new file reachu-sdk.js and
add the following code.

```js
import { SdkClient } from '@reachu/sdk';

let sdk;

export function getSDK() {
  if (!sdk) sdk = new SdkClient('YOUR_API_KEY', 'https://api.reachu.io');
  return sdk;
}
```

This function will do mainly two things: Initialize the connection with Reachu
(enabling the SDK and the checkout solution) and provide an API client that we
can use to retrieve content from the platform, to be used in our application.

In the Reachu platform, create a new Channel.
