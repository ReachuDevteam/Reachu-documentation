## Configuration

To configure and customize the plugin, you have to go through four different
configuration categories:

### General

      your Stripe Key.
- [ ] You also have the option to add tracking and analytics through Mixpanel,
      Hotjar, and Google Analytics.

#### Configuration Update

For the users that don't have Gutemberg on their WordPress there is a new
feature that allows you to create **Shortcodes** for your post and publish the
products there. To activate it turn on the switch called **Gutemberg is not
implemented on this WordPress** and save the changes.

A **Shortcodes** tab will appear and then you will be able to create your
shortcodes with the products you chose and then you can add this shortcode on
you Wordpress posts.

### Logo

- [ ] Add the logo you want to appear in your checkout.

<a href="Your facebook link">
