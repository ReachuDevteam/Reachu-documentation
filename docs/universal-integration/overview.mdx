# Overview

:::info Please be aware that this Universal Ecommerce Integration is currently
in an Alpha release phase. This means the feature is in active development and
may undergo changes or modifications based on feedback and testing.

:::info It's important to note that this solution is in Alpha mode and may
require support from the Reachu development team. :::

Here's what you'll achieve with this integration:

- #### Product Synchronization:

  Keep your product details up-to-date across both systems. Changes in product
  information, such as pricing or descriptions, will be reflected on our
  platform.

- #### Order Synchronization:

  Ensure that every order on your ecommerce platform is immediately updated on
  our system. No more delays or manual updates.

- #### Stock Level Synchronization:
  Maintain accurate and consistent stock levels. When stock levels change in
  your ecommerce system, they will be updated on our platform.

The following guide, documentation and tutorial is made to help you get started.
