## Introduction

you import products from Reachu to your store. The application automatically
synchronize product information and inventory, while all orders are placed back
to the supplier or brand it was sourced from. Whether youÂ´re a dropshipper,
retailer or simply want to connect more of your storefronts, Reachu is built to
ensure product and order data is up to date and synchronized across your
ecosystem.
