import product listings from Reachu.

</font>

## Introduction

**Reachu is the API for product data access**. Channels can use Reachu to get
access to product data from multiple Suppliers.

The "[Reachu](https://wordpress.org/plugins/reachu-export/)" WooCommerce
application lets Channels connect and sync their WooCommerce store with Reachu.
This enables Channels to select and automatically import products from Reachu to
their WooCommerce with one click. Reachu ensures that product data, stock,
fulfillment, and shipping information is synchronized with each of the Suppliers
eCommerce systems.
