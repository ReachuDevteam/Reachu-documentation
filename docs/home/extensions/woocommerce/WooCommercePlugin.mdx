## Introduction

**Outshifter is the API for product data access**. Channels can use Outshifter to get access to product data from multiple Suppliers.

The "[Outshifter](https://wordpress.org/plugins/outshifter-export/)" WooCommerce application lets Channels connect and sync their WooCommerce store with Outshifter. This enables Channels to select and automatically import products from Outshifter to their WooCommerce with one click. Outshifter ensures that product data, stock, fulfillment, and shipping information is synchronized with each of the Suppliers eCommerce systems.
