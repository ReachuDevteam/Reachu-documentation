<font color="grey" size="5" >Best practices to start using the Outshifter GraphQL API for Channels.</font>

---

First and foremost:

- [ ] In order to get started, you need to [request access](https://outshifter.typeform.com/to/uf0OQJWn)  to register an Outshifter Channel account.

- [ ] On the Outshifter platform, you can choose which Suppliers and products you will be working with and build up your product Catalog.

​
Once you´re set up we recommend you to:

- [ ] Familiarize yourself with our **architecture** structure. If you want to use the GraphQL API, you will need to learn how to interact with the Outshifter dashboard.

- [ ] See the **endpoint documentation**. We have detailed explanations for how to retrieve product data, use the checkout, create an order etc.

- [ ] Use the **playground**. This will help you understand and better decide what you need for your use.

There are two primary ways of quickly getting started with the Outshifter GraphQL Channel API solution:

- **CLI**: You can download the command-line interface (CLI) from npm and use it to initiate a new project: 

```npm install== --global @outshifter/cli && outshifter init```

- **SDK**: With our starter project you'll have a preconfigured Outshifter kick-start storefront template and fully working front-end in your chosen framework, in minutes. All deployed and sourced on GitHub.
