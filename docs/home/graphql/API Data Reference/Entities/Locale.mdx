Locales should be formatted as a language tag consisting of a two-letter language code combined with a two-letter country code according to [`RFC 5646`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IETF_language_tag). Examples are *en-us* for US English, *en-gb* for British English and *nb-no* for Norwegian.

Example:

```javascript
{
  "locale": "nb-no",
}
```
