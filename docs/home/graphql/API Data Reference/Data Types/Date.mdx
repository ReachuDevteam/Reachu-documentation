The Date type represents a Date value as specified by [iso8601](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601) standard with combined date, time and timezone.

```javascript
type Date
```
Example:

```javascript
{
    "createdAt": "2018-08-08T08:37:22Z"
}
```
In some cases, we also accept values in the YYYY-MM-DD format, for example when filtering. Check the body request examples on each endpoint.

Example:

```javascript
{
    "dateFrom": "1981-09-06"
}
```
