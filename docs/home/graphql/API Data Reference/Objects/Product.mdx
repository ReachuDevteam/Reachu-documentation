**`sku (String)`**

A stock-keeping unit (SKU) is a scannable bar code, most often seen printed on product labels in a retail store. The label allows vendors to automatically track the movement of inventory. The SKU is composed of an alphanumeric combination of eight-or-so characters. The characters are a code that track the price, product details, and the manufacturer.

It is a method of representing data in a visual, machine-readable form. We use the [Universal Product Code (UPC)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Product_Code).
