Outshifter has 3 types of users:

- **`suppliers`**: The brands. They list and ship the products.
- **`sellers`**: The sales channels. They sell the products in our storefronts.
- **`customers`**: The final consumer. They buy and receive the purchased
  products.

Suppliers and sellers management is performed through our Core Api Solution, so
it is not on the scope of this GraphQL Sales Channel Api.

If you have not created your seller yet, please refer to
[User Creation](https://app.gitbook.com/o/I1VOeCf1Kk9QYomzSAiO/s/z9iM6vbFkU4ylWcyVMCY/getting-started/api-key-authentication).

## Customers

As a sales channel, you will be dealing with the creation and management of the
final customer. You can create your own sign up or just use it for purposes.

Every customer must have these fields:

- **`id`**: The unique user identifier.
- **`email`**: Used to login
- **`phone`**: Contact phone information.
- **`shippingAddress`**: Address to receive the product.
- **`billingAddress`**: Address related to billing.
