## API URLs

To access the Outshifter API, combine the base URL + endpoint. For instance, in order to "retrieve an order" construct the URL to call as follows: BASE URL for environment + /users/me/orders/ â†’ https://api.outshifter.com/users/me/orders/

Use the testing environments to familiarize yourself with the API and to try new things; use the live environments to start real transactions with Outshifter.

:::info
Use HTTPS for all your interactions with the Outshifter API.
:::

Base URL Live (production) = https://api.outshifter.com/

Base URL Testing (playground) = https://api-qa.outshifter.com/

## API Key (Authentication)

The Outshifter API Key is used as authentication for all your Outshifter API requests. You need access to your Outshifter Account in order to generate the API Key.

If you haven't already set up an Outshifter Account you need to [register](https://app.outshifter.com/register-merchant) for one in order to continue.

### Generate Api key

- Log in to your Outshifter Account, go to settings (available in the top right hand corner) and select [Sales Channels](https://app.outshifter.com/settings/integrations).

- Click on the create button. This will automatically generate the API Key for your user.

- The Key can be used as an authentication method for all your Outshifter API requests.

## Authentification

In order to send requests to the Outshifter API, you need to be authenticated and supply a token for all requests. Every user in the Outshifter platform has an authorisation token or API Key.

:::info
Your API requests will not work unless you include the API token. Make sure you add the API token to the request in the headers as an authorisation key.
