Product data and object explanations.

</font>

WeÂ´ve divided product data into general commercial information regarding a product and Outshifter's internal information designed to be interacted with.

### Commercial Information

Commercial information is used for being displayed on your frontend such as your storefront, or through one of Outshifter's integrations or extensions. All commercial information is provided by the supplier.

#### Product core

- **`id`** (number): The unique product id
- **`title`** (string): The product title
- **`price`** (object): The product price

```javascript
{
    "price": {
        "amount": "99.99",
        "currencyCode": "NOK"
    }
}
```
- **`amount`** (number): The product price amount. Should be in decimals. If no decimals, .00 will be added by default.
- **`currency`** (string): The product currency price. We use the ISO 4217 standard for defining currencies. Examples are USD, GBP, EUR or SEK.
- **`quantity`** (number): The available stock. This field is updated each time you receive product information. It is an important field to validate at the moment of the purchase to check for possibles out of stock.

#### Images

Images are associated with products and can be used to render product galleries. All product images are uploaded into our database. Images are fetched with the following order:

- order: 0 means cover image. It should be 4:5 ratio.
- order: 1 means main product image
- order >= 2 is related to the remaining gallery images.

```javascript
{
    "images": [
        {
            "url": "url",
            "width": 600,
            "height": 900,
            "order": 0
        },
        {
            "url": "url",
            "width": 1000,
            "height": 1000,
            "order": 1
        }
    ]
}
```
#### Supplier

- **`supplier`** (object): All key information about the supplier.

```javascript
{
    "supplier": {
        "id": 1,
        "name": "Supplier Name",
        "avatar": "url"
    }
}
```
- supplier -> id (number): The unique id of the user

Options & Variations

- options (array): It contains the variations groups, such as size or colour.
  - -> name: The name of the variation group.
  - -> value: The list of options in the group.

```javascript

  "options": [
    {
      "name": "Size",
      "value": "Small,Medium,Large"
    },
    {
      "name": "Color",
      "value": "White,Black"
    }
  ]
}
```
- variations (array): Each variation displayed
  - -> title: The combination of the different variation options.
  - -> price: The price for that particular variation. It is generally the same, but there are cases where it may vary.
  - -> quantity: The inventory level of the variation. This is an important and dynamic field as it can be updated between each new request.

            "price": 1500.00,
