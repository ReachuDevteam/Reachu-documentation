How to get the most out of the documentation, particularly endpoint information
displays.

</font>

### General overview

This section explains how to properly read an endpoint in the documentation.
Each endpoint is displayed in the form of an accordion, so keep in mind that
every time you see an arrow like the highlighted in red below, it means that
there is further information available.

References:

**`GET`**: Type of endpoint requests, including PUT, POST, DELETE and GET.

**`https://api.outshifter.com/catalog/users/:id/products:`** The address to send
the required operation to the endpoint.

**`Multiple products by user id`**: The endpoint title

### Parameters

Once you open the accordion to get further information, you will see the
included endpoint parameters. It includes the field, type of data and a
description of what is required.

References:

`Path`: Parameter that is included in the address of the endpoint. In the
example, it is the user id.

`Header`: Primarily used for authentication. For every endpoint that requires
authentication, it should be included in the header.

`Body`: The payload. In the example, it is the option to apply filters, but it
can also be an object with information required to create a new user.

### Responses

When you open the "Responses" tab, you will get the type of response and the
expected response data. In the below example we see that the response is an
array with all the selected supplierÂ´s products.
