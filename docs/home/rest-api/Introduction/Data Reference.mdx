</font>

An overview of the general data types used in the API as well as specifics regarding user data and product data.

### General Data Types

#### Currency

We use the ISO 4217 standard for defining currencies. Examples are USD, GBP, EUR or SEK.

```javascript
{
    "priceCurrency": "USD"
}
```
#### Amount

Product prices should include decimals.

```javascript
{
    "price": 100.00
}
```
#### Date

Dates are expressed according to the ISO 8601 standard with combined date, time and timezone. In some cases, we also accept values in the YYYY-MM-DD format, for example when filtering. Check the body request examples on each endpoint.

```javascript
{
    "createdAt": "2018-08-08T08:37:22Z",
    "dateFrom": "1981-09-06"
}
```
#### String

Strings may be up to 255 characters, unless otherwise noted in the field description.

#### Locale & Country

Locales should be formatted as a language tag consisting of a two-letter language code combined with a two-letter country code according to [RFC 5646](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IETF_language_tag). Examples are *en-us* for US English, *en-gb* for British English and *nb-no* for Norwegian.

Countries are handled as two-letter country codes according to [ISO 3166 alpha-2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1_alpha-2). Examples are *US* for the United States, *GB* for Great Britain and *NO* for Norway.

```javascript
{
  "locale": "nb-no",
  "country": "NO"
}
```
