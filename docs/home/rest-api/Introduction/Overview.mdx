Outshifter REST API developer documentation.

</font>

Welcome to the Outshifter REST API developer documentation. This API allows you to fetch product data from your Outshifter catalog and use it on your own surface. For instance in order to sell products natively within your own application, game, or webpage. Here you'll find introductions to all features, as well as resources, guides, and reference documentation for the APIÂ´s data structure.

We recommend you familiarize yourself with the three other introduction sections before starting:

- **[`Getting Started`](#GettingStarted)**: What you need to start using our REST API.
- **[`Docu Guidelines`](#DocuGuidelines)**: How to get the best of the documentation - particularly endpoint information displays.
- **[`Data types`](#DataTypes)**: An overview of the data types used for the most important fields and examples of defined objects, e.g. a product or a user.

### Channel API

The Channel API enables you to fetch product data from your Outshifter Catalog to your own surface. For instance, in order to sell products natively in your game, application or webpage. How you chooses to display or work with the data is highly customizable and the API comes with a set of functionalities and integrations such as payment gateways, shipping rates and trigger notifications. All product data is continuously synchronized with Suppliers through Outshifter.

### Platform API

This is the core of Outshifter. This guide will provide you with all primary endpoints to interact with general information on our main platform solution, such as available suppliers or product categories. If you want to go deeper, see user management (user creation and role assignation) or request access to our Admin endpoints.

### Returns API

Outshifter offers a fully automated returns API that lets you handle returns post-purchase on your Channel. It allows the final customer to return a product given that it meets certain requirements. The API lets you create new returns, validate key requirements and fetch return delivery information.
