The Reachu SDK allows you to import products from Reachu and add ecommerce to
any platform or application.

It's based on Reachu's API and provides the ability to retrieve products and
collections from your Reachu account, add products to a cart, payments and
checkout. Reachu ensures that product data, stock, fulfillment, and shipping
information is synchronized with all of the Merchants ecommerce systems.

The following guide, documentation and tutorial is made to help you get started.
